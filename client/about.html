                <p class="aboutMePage">
                  I'm a software developer with a strong foundation in programming languages and tools, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Java. I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Weber State University, and I'm currently studying Java Software Engineering at Devmountain.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutMePage">
                  During my time at Devmountain, I gained hands-on experience working as a student Web Developer and Software Engineer, where I learned how to work collaboratively and creatively to deliver high-quality products. I also have experience in customer service, sales, and logistics, which helped me develop my communication and organizational skills.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutMePage">
                  Outside of work, I have a passion for golfing, basketball, skiing, and traveling with my fiancee and my dog Jerry. Golfing is a sport that challenges me both mentally and physically, and I enjoy the opportunity to spend time outdoors. Basketball is a great way to blow off steam and stay active, and skiing is one of my favorite winter activities. When I'm not on the court or the slopes, I love to explore new places with my fiancee and our furry companion Jerry.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutMePage">
                  With my technical expertise, business acumen, and diverse interests, I'm confident that I can contribute positively to any software development team.
